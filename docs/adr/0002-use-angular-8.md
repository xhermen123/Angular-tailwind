# 2. Use Angular 8

Date: 2019-11-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

A modern UI framework needs to be used

## Decision

Chris and Shane have decided to give the most recent (at the time of this ADR) version of Angular (v8) a try.

## Consequences

### Pros
* Using a standard UI framework will make it easier to onboard new developers and work with external contractors
* New version of Angular offers more functionality and performance than older versions

### Cons
* Team will need to learn a new JS framework
* Build process is more complex than older versions (though this would be true of any modern framework)
